This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
df <- read_csv("/Users/jsusser/Dropbox/thesis/4_CPS/clean_HPV/output/current_values.csv")
df <- df %>%
  filter(Year<=2008)

```
```{r}
kf <- 
  bind_rows(
  df %>%
    filter(Years_school<12) %>%
    mutate(type="HSG"),
  df %>%
    filter(Years_school>=12 & Years_school <16) %>%
    mutate(type="SMC"),
   df %>%
  filter(Years_school == 16 |Years_school == 17) %>%
    mutate(type="CLG"),
  df %>%
  filter(Years_school >=18) %>%
    mutate(type="GTC")
  )


df = kf
df <- df %>%
  filter(Female==1 | Male==1)
```


```{r}
distinct <- df %>%
  select(type) %>%
  distinct()
hf <- df %>%
  
  group_by(Female,type,Year) %>%

  summarize(log=mean(log10(Wage)))

female <-filter(hf, Female==1)
male <-filter(hf, Female==0)
```


```{r}
lf <- female %>%
  inner_join(male, by<-c("Year"="Year", "type"="type"))
lf
```


```{r}
ggplot(female, aes(y = log,x = Year,color = type)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Mean Log Wage")+
  ggtitle("Female")

ggplot(male, aes(y = log,x = Year,color = type)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Male")+
labs(y = "Mean Log Wage")
ggsave("/Users/jsusser/Desktop/years_school.png", width = 10, height=7)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
